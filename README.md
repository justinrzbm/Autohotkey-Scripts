# Autohotkey-Scripts
All the Autohotkey do-dads I've conjured up for my personal convenience, some worse than others.

From the Autohotkey website:

> Autohotkey is a "AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc."

Autohotkey will be needed to compile these files. (I may add executables later)
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
